# Unmanned Fire Detection Robot - Circuit Connections

Since a full Fritzing (.fzz) file cannot be created directly in this environment, I'll provide detailed connection instructions that can be used to create the circuit diagram in Fritzing.

## Components Required:

1. Arduino Mega 2560
2. 3× HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors
3. L298N Motor Driver
4. 2× DC Motors (for rear wheels)
5. 1× Servo Motor (for front steering)
6. MQ-2 Gas Sensor
7. NEO-6M GPS Module
8. QMC5883L Digital Compass
9. SX1278 LoRa Module
10. Voltage Divider (10kΩ and 2kΩ resistors)
11. TATTU 2300mAh 14.8V LiPo Battery
12. 2× DC-DC Buck Converters (14.8V to 5V and 14.8V to 6V)

## Connection Details:

### Power Distribution:
- TATTU 14.8V LiPo Battery → Main Power Switch
- Main Power Switch → Voltage Divider (for battery monitoring)
- Main Power Switch → 5V Buck Converter → Arduino Mega, Sensors, GPS, LoRa

  - Echo → Pin 7
  - VCC → 5V
  - GND → GND

#### L298N Motor Driver:
- ENA → Pin 9 (PWM)
- IN1 → Pin 22
- IN2 → Pin 23
- ENB → Pin 8 (PWM)
- IN3 → Pin 24
- IN4 → Pin 25
- 12V → Battery (via switch)
- GND → GND

#### Servo Motor:
- Signal → Pin 11 (PWM)

- MISO → Pin 50
- SCK → Pin 52
- NSS → Pin 53
- RST → Pin 49
- DIO0 → Pin 48
- VCC → 3.3V
- GND → GND

## Fritzing Diagram Instructions:

1. Place the Arduino Mega 2560 in the center of the breadboard view
2. Add all components around it
3. Connect power distribution first:
   - Add battery, switch, and buck converters
   - Connect power lines to all components
4. Connect signal lines according to the pin assignments above
5. Group related components together (e.g., ultrasonic sensors, motor control)
6. Use different wire colors for clarity:
   - Red for positive power
   - Black for ground
   - Yellow for signal/data lines
   - Blue for I2C connections
   - Green for SPI connections

## Notes:

1. The PPS pin from the GPS module shares Pin 2 with the front ultrasonic sensor trigger. In a real implementation, you might need to use a different pin or implement time-sharing between these functions.

2. The MQ-2 sensor requires a warmup period (implemented in the code with a 20-second delay).

3. The voltage divider for battery monitoring should be adjusted based on the actual battery voltage and Arduino reference voltage.

4. The L298N motor driver might require additional connections for motor power depending on the specific module used.

5. The QMC5883L compass should be mounted away from motors and other magnetic sources to avoid interference.
