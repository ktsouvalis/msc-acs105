# Active Context: Current Project State

## Current Work Focus
**Memory Bank Initialization** - Successfully creating the foundational documentation system for the UVS Fire Detection Robot project to preserve context across development sessions.

## Recent Changes
- **Project Analysis**: Analyzed existing codebase and documentation to understand current implementation state
- **Memory Bank Structure**: Created comprehensive documentation framework following .clinerules specifications
- **Context Preservation**: Established systematic approach to maintaining project knowledge
- **Gap Identification**: Identified missing components between current basic navigation and full fire detection system

## Next Steps
1. **Code Integration Review**: Analyze gap between current basic navigation code and documented full system requirements
2. **Missing Component Implementation**: Add fire detection (MQ-2), GPS navigation, LoRa communication, and digital compass
3. **System Integration Testing**: Test all subsystems working together harmoniously
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize power consumption and response times
5. **Field Testing Preparation**: Prepare system for real-world testing scenarios

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Arduino Mega 2560**: Currently using ATmega2560 but ESP32 considered for future upgrade
- **Right-Hand Rule Navigation**: Proven algorithm for systematic area exploration
- **Ackermann Steering**: Precise directional control suitable for confined debris navigation
- **LoRa Communication**: 433MHz selected for optimal range/power balance in emergency scenarios
- **Multi-Sensor Approach**: Reduces false positives in fire detection through sensor fusion

### Current Implementation Gap Analysis
**What's Working (Basic Navigation)**:
- Right-hand rule algorithm implemented
- Ultrasonic obstacle detection (front + right sensors)
- Motor control with Ackermann steering
- Wall following with distance control

**Critical Missing Components**:
- Fire detection system (MQ-2 gas sensor integration)
- GPS positioning for emergency coordinates
- LoRa telemetry transmission
- Digital compass for heading reference
- Battery monitoring and power management
- Emergency alert protocol

### Design Patterns in Use
- **State Machine Pattern**: Navigation states (PATROL, EVALUATE, TURN_LEFT, TURN_RIGHT, TURN_AROUND)
- **Sensor Fusion Pattern**: Multiple ultrasonic sensors for comprehensive obstacle detection
- **Polling Pattern**: Current sensor reading approach (100ms loop cycle)
- **Priority-based Processing**: Safety (obstacle avoidance) takes precedence over other functions

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization Philosophy
- **Modular Structure**: Separate functions for navigation, detection, communication, motor control
- **Configuration-Driven**: Use #define constants for easy parameter adjustment
- **Non-blocking Design**: Avoid delays that interrupt critical navigation timing
- **Error Handling**: Robust operation despite individual sensor failures
- **Memory Efficiency**: Careful management of limited 8KB SRAM on ATmega2560

### Hardware Integration Patterns
- **Pin Assignment Strategy**: Logical grouping (sensors on low pins, motors on PWM pins)
- **Power Distribution**: Separate voltage rails for different subsystem requirements
- **Communication Interfaces**: Dedicated UART ports for GPS and LoRa modules
- **Expansion Planning**: Reserved pins for future sensor additions

### Navigation Control Philosophy
```cpp
// Current navigation constants
const int NORMAL_SPEED = 200;      // PWM value for normal operation
const int SLOW_SPEED = 50;         // PWM value when approaching obstacles
const int DESIRED_RIGHT_DIST = 20; // Target wall following distance (cm)
const int FRONT_SLOW_DIST = 50;    // Distance to start slowing down (cm)
const int FRONT_STOP_DIST = 20;    // Distance to stop and turn (cm)
```

### Safety-First Design Principles
- **Obstacle Avoidance Priority**: Navigation safety overrides all other functions
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operation if non-critical sensors fail
- **Conservative Thresholds**: Safety margins built into all distance measurements
- **Emergency Stop Capability**: Immediate motor shutdown on critical failures

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights from Current Implementation
- **Servo Delay Timing**: 600ms delay needed for servo movement in turnLeft() function
- **Sensor Tolerance**: Â±2cm tolerance needed for wall following to prevent oscillation
- **PWM Speed Control**: 200/50 PWM values provide good speed differentiation
- **Loop Timing**: 100ms main loop provides responsive navigation without sensor interference

### Hardware Integration Lessons
- **Pin Conflict Avoidance**: Careful planning needed for pin assignments with motor drivers
- **Power Supply Stability**: Buck converters essential for stable sensor operation
- **Mechanical Considerations**: Ackermann steering requires proper servo calibration
- **Sensor Placement**: Ultrasonic sensor positioning critical for accurate readings
