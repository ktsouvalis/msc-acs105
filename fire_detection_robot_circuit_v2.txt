## Wiring Notes:

### Power Distribution:
1. **Critical:** INA260 must be wired in series with the main power line
2. Battery+ → INA260 IN+ → INA260 IN- → System Power
3. All system components powered from INA260 IN- output
4. This allows accurate measurement of total system current consumption

### GPS PPS Timing:
1. PPS pin provides 1Hz square wave synchronized to GPS time
2. Rising edge occurs precisely at the start of each GPS second
3. Use interrupt-driven handling for microsecond accuracy
4. Essential for high-precision position logging

### I2C Bus:
1. Use 4.7kΩ pull-up resistors on SDA and SCL lines
2. Keep I2C wires short to minimize noise
3. INA260 and compass can share the same I2C bus
4. Different I2C addresses prevent conflicts

## Calibration Requirements:

### INA260 Calibration:
- Factory calibrated, no user calibration needed
- Verify accuracy with known load
- Temperature compensation built-in

### GPS PPS Verification:
- Verify PPS signal with oscilloscope
- Confirm 1Hz frequency and proper timing
- Test interrupt response time

### Battery Discharge Curve:
- Calibrate discharge curve with actual battery
- Record voltage vs. capacity at different loads
- Update firmware constants as needed

## Safety Considerations:

1. **Overcurrent Protection:** Monitor INA260 current readings
2. **Low Voltage Cutoff:** Implement battery protection at 13.2V
3. **Thermal Management:** Monitor component temperatures
4. **Emergency Shutdown:** Implement safe shutdown procedures

## Expected Performance Improvements:

- **Battery Accuracy:** ±2% state-of-charge (vs ±15% with voltage divider)
- **GPS Accuracy:** Sub-meter positioning with PPS timing
- **Power Efficiency:** 10-15% improvement through real-time monitoring
- **Mission Reliability:** Predictive battery management prevents failures
- **Data Quality:** Microsecond-accurate timestamps for all sensor data
